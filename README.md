# Predicting-earnings-manipulation-using-Machine-Learning-Alogorithms
Developed a logistic regression model for predicting probability of earnings manipulation.

Developed classification and regression tree (CART) model. 

Develoedp a logistic regression model using the complete data set and compare the results with the previous logistic regression model.

Developed models using machine learning algorithms such as random forest. Compared the outputs from these methods with logistic regression and classification tree.
