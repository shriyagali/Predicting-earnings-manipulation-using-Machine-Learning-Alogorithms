# Predicting-earnings-manipulation-using-Machine-Learning-Alogorithms
Develop a logistic regression model for predicting probability of earnings manipulation.

Develop classification and regression tree (CART) model. What insights do you obtain from the CART model?

Develop a logistic regression model using the complete data set (1200 non-manipulators and 39 manipulators), compare the results with the previous logistic regression model.

Develop models using machine learning algorithms such as random forest. Compare the outputs from these methods with logistic regression and classification tree.
